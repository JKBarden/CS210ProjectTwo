Monthly interest calculator with and without monthly investment


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

 	-This project's main function is to take in three variables (initial deposit, interest rate, annual interest rate, and years of investment). With these the program calculates the account balance with interest per month. There are two separate columns that calculate the balance with and without additional deposits.  

This helps the user see what their investment will become over time and the importance of continuous investment.  

  
What did you do particularly well? 

	- The thing I tried different, and I feel helped organize the code a little bit was to break up certain outputs into header and body blocks of code. With this I could find and modify the code to have better formatting. 


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

	-There was unused code that was used to troubleshoot left in the header file, that is wasted memory. There are also globally declared variables and local variables that could be rewritten to avoid multiple variables. 


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

	-Calculating the monthly interest was difficult and keeping track of the balance per year. The formula to calculate monthly interest was straightforward but I had multiple issues getting the correct interest. 

 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

	-This project I had an issue with getting a much larger end deposit amount. After taking a break and just slowing working through the program I found the I was not resetting the yearly interest. Simply zeroing the interest earned this year after the inner loop resolved that issue. Following the program's flow is an important skill that will help in future projects. 


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

	-Keeping adequate white space with short but descriptive variables helps maintain clarity and readability of the program. Also, having a short comment on important methods and reasoning for certain lines of code will help others understand the code.
